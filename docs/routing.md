# Routing

## Locale

Symfony is setup to set the locale based on URL paths. E.g. `/ja` for Japanese. If no URL path is setup
then English is set as the default locale.

Setup in [annotations.yaml](../config/routes/annotations.yaml)

## Routing

[Annotations](https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html#creating-routes-as-attributes-or-annotations) are used in controllers to define routes.
