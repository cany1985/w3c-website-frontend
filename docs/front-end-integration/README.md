# Front-end integration

The following is an overview on how to integrate HTML/CSS templates with content (from a CMS or other data 
sources) in Symfony to create finished web pages with real content. We are using the 
[Strata](https://github.com/strata/frontend) library to help integrate with headless CMS and other data 
sources. CraftCMS uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) for all API queries.
