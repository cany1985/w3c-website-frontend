# Adding languages

Use the [two-character ISO 639-1 locale code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) to identify the 
locale. To keep clean URLs we use `-` instead of `_` and lower-case.

For example French is `fr`, Portuguese - Brazil is `pt-br`

Below we'll use the character `{lc}` to refer to the locale code.

## Craft CMS

You need to setup a site in Craft with the correct locale language. Make a note of the site ID since we need to set 
this in the frontend app.

TODO - Marie

## Routing

Add the language URL prefix to [config/routes/annotations.yml](../config/routes/annotations.yaml) in 
`controllers.prefix` in the format:

```yaml
{lc}: '/{lc}'
```

E.g. for French:

```yaml
fr: '/fr'
```

See [Internationalized routing](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-4-1-internationalized-routing).

## Hosting platform routing

Please note only fixed prefixes are routed from w3.org to the Symfony app. To ensure the new language route points to 
the Symfony frontend web app ...

TODO - W3C

## Frontend site setup

Edit the `src/Service/SiteConfigurator.php` file and add the locale along with the CraftCMS site ID. This helps auto-set the
correct site ID when retrieving content. It also helps set whether content is left-to-right (default) or right-to-left.

In the format:

```php
$site->addLocale('{lc}', ['siteId' => {number}]);
```

For example, to add German:

```php
$site->addLocale('de', ['siteId' => 8]);
```

You can use `$site->addRtfLocale()` to add a right-to-left locale. For example, to add Arabic:

```php
$site->addRtfLocale('ar', ['siteId' => 9]);
```

## Translation messages file

Add a file to `translations/js+intl-icu.{lc}.yaml` (JavaScript messages) and `translations/messages+intl-icu.{lc}.yaml` 
(website messages), using the English (`en`) file as the starting point.

Please note if a messages file does not exist the application defaults to English.  

See [translation messages](internationalization.md#messages).
